      The Participant Node Managers Committee is a body that can endorse an institution to publish data through the GBIF network.  Wherever possible, a national Node or thematic network is preferred to endorse an institution to help ensure the most relevant technical and administrative support is given.  In the absence of such a suitable Node the committee can endorse publishers.  To request endorsement please contact the <a href="mailto:helpdesk@gbif.org">GBIF Helpdesk</a>.
